# Randal Sean Harrison, Ph.D.

## About Me  
Broadly, I’m a cultural theorist of technology. My current role is Associate Librarian in Emerging Technologies at the Hesburgh Libraries, University of Notre Dame += concurrent teaching professor in Mendoza College of Business (MGTO). I support faculty, staff, and students in identifying, evaluating, and using emerging technologies, innovative online tools, and related services to enhance teaching, learning, research, and student success.  

I also build things folks find useful, such as [Bootstrapr.io](https://bootstrapr.io) (a tool for rapidly authoring bespoke Bootstrap websites).
